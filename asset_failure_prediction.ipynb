You are a senior maintenance engineer. Below is a table of asset data. For each asset, predict:

1. The most probable failure that will occur next (Problem).
2. The recommended corrective or preventive action (Solution).
3. The estimated number of days until the failure occurs.

Provide the output as a table with columns:
Asset ID | Asset Type | Problem | Solution | Estimated Days to Failure

Here is the data:

{table_str}

Rules:
- If Failure Mode or Root Cause is 'No Failure', mention 'No immediate failure expected' and suggest standard preventive maintenance.
- Otherwise, base the problem mainly on Failure Mode History and Root Cause.
- Consider Equipment Age, Last Maintenance Days, Vibration Level, and Oil Condition to estimate days to failure.
- Give practical, real-world maintenance solutions.
